1. install ubuntu 16.05

2. install vmware
https://itsfoss.com/install-vmware-player-ubuntu-1310/

comes down to downloading the bundle, making it executable and running it, this installs the vmplayer.

at first start it asks the user agreements ...


3. download phytec mira container for vmware and unzip
4. follow installation instructions under readme from phytec
https://www.phytec.de/documents/vm-readme/

5 bios settings
under cpu cofnig enable virtualziation technologies
under miscelanous config enable vt-d

6. start vm machine, it install some updates

7 top left - virtual machine - machine settings it shows the HS
add a NAT and configure :
start at power on
per defualt the NAT adapter is set to share the hosts ip address which the mira doesn't know 
hence under network connection select bridged - direct physical connection
the VM then uses the wired1 configuration settings of the VM
those have to be configured as per manual:
set ipv4 settings to 192.168.3.10
the mira is 192.168.3.11

this finds the mira on the network

problem:
host key verification fails, because the ssh keys in the vm are different on the machine were the container was created
hence delete the config so that it can be updated

ssh-keygen -R 192.168.3.11

after that the ssh script works and connects to the mira board


----------------------------------------

to use git clone the repo onto the host
under vm - settings - options create a shared folder to the git repo and set it activve
this folder appears under /mnt/hgfs on the vm directory structure




----------------------------------------


when the vm sleeps, on wakeup it want the password in german key board layout -> y is z
